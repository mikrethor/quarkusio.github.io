                Another week, another interesting question. This week, someone asks me about combining Kafka and the Rest Client. That is a recurring subject, and most of the time, the goal is to achieve the following process: In other words, we want to call a remote service for each Kafka message we...

                I got an interesting question from a user about Redis and Mutiny. While the problem was not specifically about Redis and could be applied to many other APIs, I found the context amusing. Enrico, the user, wanted to do something like this: 1. get all keys from Redis 2. for...

            <description>
                The Quarkus project moves fast and when we prepare bugfix releases, we usually have several dozens of pull requests to backport. The number of pull requests to backport is enormous and doing it via the GitHub UI is inconvenient and takes a lot of time (click PR, copy/paste commit hashes...

            <description>
                In the past week, I got several questions about failure handling with Mutiny. So, maybe it deserves a bit more explanation. Failures are events First, Mutiny is an event-driven reactive programming library. With Mutiny, you handle events. An upstream Uni or Multi propagates these events and gives you the possibility...

                Have you ever generated a Quarkus project using the Maven plugin or code.quarkus.io? If you did, then you might have wondered why, with the breadth of Quarkus extensions, we would only let you generate a REST API example application. Of course, you can pick extensions which are going to be...
